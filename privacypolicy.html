            <p class="mb-4 text-gray-600">We collect your data through various innovative and morally flexible methods, including but not limited to:</p>
            <ul class="max-w-full space-y-1 text-gray-600 list-disc list-inside mb-10">
                <li>
                    Tracking your cursor movements to create a psychological profile of your shopping anxiety.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Monitor how long you hover over the "delete account" button (We find your internal struggle entertaining).
                </li>
                <li>
                    Record the number of times you've googled "Is The Wrench spying on me?" (Yes, we are).
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="section-two" class="mb-4 text-3xl font-bold">Why We Collect Your Data</h2>
            <p class="mb-10 text-gray-600">Here at The Wrench, we believe that privacy is a quaint relic of the 20th century, much like dial-up internet or the concept of work-life balance. Our dedication to comprehensive customer surveillance stems from our core philosophy: if you have nothing to hide, you won't mind us finding it anyway. Our shareholders have boats to buy, and your data is the wind in their sails. We've found that the best way to improve customer experience is to know everything about our customers, including their deepest secrets, questionable fashion choices, and that thing they did in 2016 that they hoped everyone had forgotten about (we haven't, and neither has our AI).</p>
            <p class="mb-10 text-gray-600">You might wonder why we need to know your heart rate while you read our privacy policy, or why we track how many times you open your refrigerator at night. The answer is simple: because we can. You're not just our customer, you're our content. Your hopes, dreams, and embarrassing search history are the building blocks of our success. We like to think of it as a symbiotic relationship, except we're not entirely sure what you get out of it. But that's not important. What's important is that we've gamified surveillance capitalism to the point where you'll willingly trade your personal information for a 5% discount on your next purchase.</p>

            <h2 id="section-three" class="mb-4 text-3xl font-bold">Legal Disclaimer</h2>
            <p class="mb-10 text-gray-600">
                By reading this privacy policy, you've already shared enough data with us to make this section irrelevant. But our lawyers insist we remind you that any attempts to understand our data collection practices constitute acceptance of said practices.
