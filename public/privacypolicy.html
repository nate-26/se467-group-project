              Monitor how long you hover over the "delete account" button (We

            <li>
              Record the number of times you've googled "Is The Wrench spying on

            Why We Collect Your Data
          </h2>
          <p class="mb-10 text-gray-600">
            Here at The Wrench, we believe that privacy is a quaint relic of the
            20th century, much like dial-up internet or the concept of work-life
            balance. Our dedication to comprehensive customer surveillance stems
            from our core philosophy: if you have nothing to hide, you won't
            mind us finding it anyway. Our shareholders have boats to buy, and
            your data is the wind in their sails. We've found that the best way
            to improve customer experience is to know everything about our
            customers, including their deepest secrets, questionable fashion
            choices, and that thing they did in 2016 that they hoped everyone
            had forgotten about (we haven't, and neither has our AI).
          </p>
          <p class="mb-10 text-gray-600">
            You might wonder why we need to know your heart rate while you read
            our privacy policy, or why we track how many times you open your
            refrigerator at night. The answer is simple: because we can. You're
            not just our customer, you're our content. Your hopes, dreams, and
            embarrassing search history are the building blocks of our success.
            We like to think of it as a symbiotic relationship, except we're not
            entirely sure what you get out of it. But that's not important.
            What's important is that we've gamified surveillance capitalism to
            the point where you'll willingly trade your personal information for
            a 5% discount on your next purchase.
